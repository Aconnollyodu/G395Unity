## Week 3
Unity package manager is a god send that allows for sharing or collaborated prefabs or already done work that users can either pay for or aqure for free. This can make life so much easier as i started using unity before package manager was as developed as it is now and prior to this you would have to manually create all of these assets yourself or scripts. General package mangers are crucial in software development not only for ease but for helping with storage and loading and so much more. Lastly, other than the fact you can sell your hard work on unity packages but you would like to create your own for ease of transfer through devices as well as overall storage saving. There is many reasons why someone would want to create unity packages but these are just a few examples.

## Week 4
Yes I have found a couple of mod kits that I wish to include within my project. One of those is the John Lemons Haunted Juant Kit, additioanly as well like we discussed within our one on one meeting I will also be including different modpacks like the dog knight I used for classwork, in addition to these other kits used will be much more small and minimal more for aesthetics and design choices. As of now I wish to utilize all of  these mod kits, although this could change depending on compiler errors and or like issues.
