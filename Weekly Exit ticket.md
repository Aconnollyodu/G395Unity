    Unity package manager is a god send that allows for sharing or collaborated prefabs or already done work that users can either pay for or aqure for free. This can make life so much easier as i started using unity before package manager was as developed as it is now and prior to this you would have to manually create all of these assets yourself or scripts. General package mangers are crucial in software development not only for ease but for helping with storage and loading and so much more.
