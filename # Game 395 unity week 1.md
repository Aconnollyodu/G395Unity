# Game 395 Unity week 1 
    Austin Connolly, 
    Unity is very exciting to me as I am very familiar with it and have been using it since 2018 however with updates and changes it will be nice to finally offically polish and practice everything that I have done so far on my own using Unity. Additionally, I feel as though Dr.Shull's expertise will vastly help improve my coding knowledge.
## Monday Unity class notes
basic intro and syllabus introduction as well as basic course overview.

###  Wednesday Unity class notes
 We learned more about markdown as well as Git and VS code and their interconnectvity. as well as how to set up a public repository in git and have it easily set up with VS code where I am creating this now. Class was exemely helpful at overall basics.
